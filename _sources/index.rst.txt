Programming in Python
#####################

This site holds a set of materials for an introductory course in Python.

THe course was originally developed by a wide variety of instructors for the 
`University of Washington Professional and Continuing Education Python Certificate <https://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/python-programming>`_
`Introductory class <https://www.pce.uw.edu/courses/programming-in-python>`_

This site can be thought of as the textbook for an introduction to programming in Python:
It contains notes about the topics covered in the classes, programming exercises, supplemental materials about setting up a development environment, and assorted references about Python-related topics.

Many of these topics can be useful on their own, but each assumes that you know concepts that were introduced earlier in the program, so working through them in order can be helpful.
