The Art of Subclassing by *Raymond Hettinger*

http://pyvideo.org/video/879/the-art-of-subclassing

The most salient points from that video are as follows:

* **Subclassing is not for Specialization**

* **Classes and subclassing are for code re-use -- not creating taxonomies**

* **Bear in mind that the subclass is in charge**

Note that the previous talk and this one were back to back at PyCon -- but despite their contradictory titles -- they have similar messages.

Stop Writing Classes
....................

by *Jack Diederich*

http://pyvideo.org/video/880/stop-writing-classes

"If your class has only two methods -- and one of them is ``__init__``
-- you don't need a class"
